## An app's home on-chain: one database root, and every table it owns.
##
## The IQ database addresses a table by (root, name). Most apps want a single
## root of their own and many tables beneath it — one per user, per document,
## per whatever the app counts — so this binds the root and the chain once and
## offers the table operations without repeating them.
##
##     var space := IQSpace.new(iq, "GodOnChain-Acme-Notebook")
##     await space.create_table("notes_alice", ["id", "body"], "id")
##     await space.write_row("notes_alice", {"id": "1", "body": "hello"})
##     var rows := await space.read_rows("notes_alice")
##
## The root is bound because it is the app; the chain is not, because it is a
## property of the operation. An app that uses both keeps one space and says
## which chain per call:
##
##     await space.on("mon").write_row("notes_alice", row)
##
## The chain given to the constructor is only the default for the common case
## of an app that never leaves one.
##
## It also hides a real difference between the chains: the EVM chains (Monad,
## Robinhood Chain) address a table by name, while Solana needs a
## program-derived address that only the root's table listing can give you.
## Callers should never have to know which chain they are on to read a row.
##
## ## Choosing a root
##
## A root is created by whoever first makes a table under it, and that creator
## is recorded on-chain. Two consequences worth deciding on deliberately, both
## of which follow from the program rather than from this class:
##
##   Fees.    `create_table` pays the root's creator. An app whose users all
##            build under one app-owned root routes those fees to the app; an
##            app where each user has their own root routes each user's fees
##            back to themselves.
##
##   Control. The root's creator may set a table-creation fee at any time, and
##            may restrict *who* can create tables under it. That second power
##            is a gate on the app's users: if your app's data only works when
##            a user can create their own table, an app-owned root means the
##            app can lock users out. Leave the creator list empty unless you
##            genuinely intend to hold that switch.
##
## A shared root also means a shared table namespace. Use scoped() to keep one
## user's tables from colliding with another's.

## The same root, on another chain.
